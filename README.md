Project Description:

Our website is a dynamic, community-driven platform designed in the spirit of Reddit. It allows users to share content, engage in discussions, and build vibrant communities around their interests—just like the real Reddit. Users can create posts, comment on discussions, upvote or downvote content, and join topic-specific communities (subreddits). In addition to these core features, our platform takes things a step further with a few innovative twists that set it apart.

Key Features:

User Accounts & Profiles:
Users can register, create personalized profiles, and manage their content contributions. Profiles display user activity, reputation scores, and a customizable bio.

Community Creation & Management:
Just like subreddits on Reddit, users can create and join communities based on niche interests. Each community has its own rules, moderators, and customized themes to foster a unique identity.

Content Posting & Rich Media Support:
Users can post text, images, videos, and links. The interface supports markdown formatting, allowing for rich, engaging content creation.

Voting System & Ranking:
Posts and comments are ranked by community votes. The upvote/downvote system ensures that quality content rises to the top, while users can also earn reputation based on their contributions.

Comment Threads & Real-Time Discussions:
Deep comment threads enable detailed discussions. Real-time updates keep conversations fresh and interactive.

Moderation Tools:
Both community moderators and automated systems work to maintain a respectful environment. Features include content reporting, flagging inappropriate posts, and AI-powered moderation support.

Search & Discovery:
Advanced search capabilities let users discover content across communities. Trending topics and personalized recommendations make it easy to find content of interest.

Mobile-Responsive Design:
The interface is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Unique Feature: Community Pulse

Beyond what traditional Reddit offers, our platform introduces the Community Pulse feature. This innovative tool provides real-time analytics and insights into community activity:

Live Sentiment Analysis:
See how discussions are trending with sentiment analysis that gauges the overall mood within a community—whether positive, negative, or neutral.

Dynamic Heatmaps:
Visual heatmaps display the most active discussion threads, helping users quickly identify hotspots of conversation and trending topics.

Personalized Alerts:
Users can opt-in to receive notifications when activity in their favorite communities reaches a certain threshold or when there are significant shifts in sentiment. This ensures that members are always in the loop about the latest community developments.
